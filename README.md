# 🧸 Storytelling app

Welcome to my project! A small attempt to make an Storytelling Application developed using FlutterFire (Flutter+Firebase). I have tried to collect all the basic features of into this application. It uses Flutter Framework for App Frontend and Backend, and Firebase as server maintaining Databases and Storage requirments of the app. It uses Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Firestore. It allows users to  quickly and easily filter stories based on their age. With this App, users can effortlessly read any story. Users can stay connected with app once they successfully logged in. There is an option where user can add or customize stories according to their choice. I developed this application just for learning purpose. I am a beginner in flutter so if you found any error feel free to solve it.
